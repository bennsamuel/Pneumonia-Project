Please take into consideration, that the current situation, due to the corona pandemic, had quite some impact on our project. \\
The early stages of the project, which included deciding on the topic, phrasing the research question and drafting the plan of attack, went as planned and everybody participated to their full extent. \\
However, the realisation of the project, which included research, coding, debugging and writing the report, was severely influenced by the current situation. \\
We insist to emphasize, that the contribution to the project in the table above are the result of an involuntary development. The non-EU exchange students in our team Pelinsu from Turkey and Josef from Australia understandably had more pressing matters to deal with under these highly dynamic circumstances. They constantly had to reevaluate measures taken by their home-countries and universities or even spontaneously organize a return flight.\\
Please take these circumstances into account, when evaluating this report. It would be highly appreciated.
