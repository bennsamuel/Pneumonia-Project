# What are the Effects of Different Preprocessing Techniques on Imbalanced Data for Image Classification Using a Deep Learning Algorithm Regarding the Detection of Pneumonia?

Deep learning can be used to detect medical conditions such as pneumonia from x-ray images. The necessary data to train deep learning algorithms from the medical field is often unbalanced due to several reasons such as one type of cause (bacterial) is more com- mon than another (viral) or the general bias towards sick patients because they are more likely to visit the doctor. Training a deep learning algorithm with unbalanced data can lead to ambiguous predictions.
However, this research shows no distinct improvement in results due to the methods undersampling, oversampling with duplicates and oversampling with augmented data by means of minor shifting, rotating, flipping and zooming.
